# Decentralized Intellectual Property Rights Management

A blockchain-based platform for transparent and efficient management of intellectual property rights, enabling secure registration, automated licensing, and streamlined royalty distribution.

## Overview

This platform modernizes intellectual property management through blockchain technology, creating an immutable record of IP ownership, automating licensing processes, and ensuring fair compensation for rights holders while providing transparent dispute resolution mechanisms.

## Core Smart Contracts

### IP Registration Contract

Manages the registration and verification of intellectual property:
- Digital fingerprint creation
- Timestamp verification
- Proof of ownership
- IP metadata storage
- Version control
- Rights transfer management
- Collaborative ownership tracking

### Licensing Contract

Facilitates automated IP licensing processes:
- License term definition
- Usage rights specification
- Geographic restrictions
- Duration management
- Sublicensing controls
- License modification tracking
- Automated compliance monitoring

### Royalty Distribution Contract

Handles automated royalty calculations and payments:
- Payment scheduling
- Revenue sharing calculations
- Multi-party distributions
- Currency conversion
- Payment verification
- Tax withholding
- Usage tracking analytics

### Dispute Resolution Contract

Manages the resolution of IP-related conflicts:
- Claim submission system
- Evidence management
- Arbitrator selection
- Voting mechanisms
- Appeal processes
- Resolution enforcement
- Penalty implementation
